- The Git rules for this repository are defined in `CONTRIBUTING.md` under "[Git Rules](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#git-rules)" and act as the single source of truth. Branch naming, commit messages, and PR title/description must follow it.
- Branch names: `main`, `dev`, `release-v{X.Y}`, `epic/{ISSUE}`, `issue/{ISSUE}[-{SUMMARY}]`.
- Commit messages: `[<TYPE>] <Summary>`, then a blank line, then bullet details.
  - Types: `feat`, `enhance`, `refactor`, `docs`, `fix`, `style`, `test`, `chore`.
  - Summary: ≤ 50 characters, English, imperative, no trailing period.
  - Details: wrap at 72 chars, written in Korean or English.
  - Example:

    ```
    [feat] Add user authentication system

    - GitHub OAuth 2.0 PKCE 플로우 구현
    - JWT 토큰 기반 인증 미들웨어 추가
    - 사용자 세션 관리 기능
    ```

- PR title: `#<ISSUE_NUMBER> [<TYPE>] <Summary>` and must be in English.
  - Example: `#123 [feat] Add user authentication system`
- PR description: use the template provided in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and fill in the required sections.
- If any discrepancy arises, `CONTRIBUTING.md` takes precedence.
