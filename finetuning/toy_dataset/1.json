      "text": "Welcome back to our Youth Month special. Um, before we dive in, Tandi, you ready? We’re honoring young folks who, like, you know, shook the ground. The day itself marks those anti–language policy protests in the 70s—students across the country, campuses, townships—standing up. And today, we’re asking you all on the WhatsApp line to share who inspired you: a teacher, a cousin, someone you admire. Also, we’ll talk about campaigns like Crown Wrights, because identity’s not cosmetic; it’s, uh, core.",

So, um, I’ve been thinking about how the current youth still carry heavy stuff—joblessness, violence against women, and, heartbreakingly, queer kids being targeted. It’s, like, gutting. Yet they keep going. I mean, this is Tandi speaking from the heart here. The person I want to celebrate is Zahra. She stood up at Coyl High when policies tried to tame her natural hair, and she, uh, didn’t flinch. She even wrote a children’s story as part of Crown Wrights, to help little ones see their coils as power instead of problem.",

      "text": "Wow, okay, that hits hard. Zahra at Coyl High—I remember, like, seeing clips where she just, you know, stood there calmly while adults were telling her to “fix” herself. It gave me chills. Identity isn’t some minor detail; it’s a major, uh, principle—wait, I always mix that with principal, haha. Anyway, the bravery at Crown Wrights events has ripple effects. And Leila, you’ve talked about how hair, especially coily textures, can be policed as a way to, um, shrink someone’s confidence.",

      "text": "Exactly! And thanks, Tandi, for, like, naming the hard stuff. The way that activist reframed “acceptable” appearance shows young people don’t need permission to be whole. When you own your look, you walk into boardrooms you never imagined. You, uh, sit at tables, you speak up. It’s the same energy that wins pageants and policies—like, a confidence that shifts rooms. And for everyone listening, send a voice note about your own champion and share stories about reclaiming a “crown.”",

She knew the risk: future opportunities, social backlash, being labeled “difficult.” And she still stood up. For me, Tandi, that shows the lesson the old protests tried to teach—use your voice now, because silence, like, steals time. And you always say confidence is contagious; when one girl lifts her chin, dozens follow.",

      "text": "Yeah, yes—exactly. And, mm, the thing that gets me is the dignity piece. People act like hair is trivial, but for Black girls, policing curls is a way to control presence. That campaign reframes it: from “problem” to “pride.” When that flip happens, you start applying for roles you thought were off-limits, you choose your course, you don’t break—uh, brake—just because someone says you don’t fit. And, you mentioned queer youth; the intersections matter. That stand speaks beyond curls, into, like, the right to be fully yourself.",

So, um, there’s a message from a parent who says their child used to hide her coils under a cap, and after reading that Crown Wrights story she walked into class with no fear. And another listener’s like, “my teacher changed my life,” which—haha—yes. The past protests weren’t just about language policy; they set a template: organize, insist, repeat. Honestly, Tandi, I feel like honoring Zahra honors every student who refuses to be edited at Coyl High-type schools, you know?",

The moment you speak, the course of the moment changes—like, the crowd pivots from idle to action. And for anyone feeling alone, tag us and the campaign; you’ll find community fast.",

My answer: it’s linked. Coyl High-style rules are part of a bigger system that decides who is welcome. Undo that, and you expand opportunity. And if you’re looking for names, Leila suggested a list: local mentors, teacher heroes, youth organizers. That point about resilience—phew—needed.",

I’m Leila, and I’m grateful we still celebrate that day in June as a reminder to keep going. To every listener—send your piece, um, peace—haha—on the line. And thanks, Tandi, for bringing this story, and thanks to campaigns like Crown Wrights for keeping the flame on.",
