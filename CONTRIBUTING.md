# Contributing to VibeVoice

Thank you for your interest in **VibeVoice**. VibeVoice is an academic-oriented research project.  
Our core principles are **code minimalism**, **high readability**, and **functional purity**.

## 1. Preferred Contributions

- **Bug Fixes & New Features**  
  These are our primary focus.

- **Minimalism First**  
  Code must be concise, clear, and minimal.

## 2. Rejected Patterns

- **Over-Engineering**  
  We will reject unnecessary encapsulation, excessive abstraction, or complex architectural refactoring.  
  Please remember this is research-purposed code, not a commercial enterprise project.

- **Style Tweaks**  
  PRs solely for formatting, beautification, or non-functional style adjustments will be rejected.
  
- **Non-English Contributions**  
  PRs containing non-English code comments, documentation, commit messages, or descriptions will be rejected.

## 3. Review Policy

- **Line-by-Line Review**  
  Maintainers strictly audit every single line of change manually. Before submitting, ensure you have personally scrutinized and fully mastered all code logic.

- **Caution Regarding AI-Generated Code**  
  LLM-generated code often contains redundant logic and subtle defects. Large chunks of AI-generated code will be rejected unless they have undergone rigorous human cleaning and verification.  
  Ensure that every line of code has an absolute necessity to exist.

## 4. Documentation Standards

- **Precise & Concise**  
  VibeVoice's documentation serves a global research community. We hold extremely high standards: changes must be succinct and accurate.  
  Please eliminate all verbosity and redundancy to ensure maximum information density.

We look forward to receiving **precise, streamlined, and substantively valuable** research contributions.
